# jobseekers

add your name to be tagged in LinkedIn posts with junior job postings!

(Still working out how to make this easy for people on LinkedIn, copy/paste does not tag people and I know how big this list is going to get)

###How to get on the list:

Make a PR on this README file, add your name exactly how you would be tagged on LinkedIn.

For example, I would add mine as _@Andrew Clarkson_

If you have an emoji, make sure it is there.

If you see your name in a job post but you aren't tagged properly, come back, make a PR and fix it.

I'll approve PRs every few days so there may be a bit of time between a PR and you being on the list.

LIST STARTS BELOW

@Andrew Clarkson
@Anna Miller
@Alison Childers
